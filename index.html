<p>a local animal rescue and adoption service that focuses on rescuing stray and abandoned pets, particularly dogs and cats (Pets) , and placing them into loving homes. The organization also works to raise awareness about responsible pet ownership, this would provide community outreach programs (like free spay/neuter days), and serves as an educational hub for pet care and services. Tail to Heart would be a platform and place to represent the journey of many rescued animals from life on the streets or in neglectful environments to becoming beloved companions in safe, nurturing homes where they may be under the correct and safe care. The name symbolizes the emotional connection between humans and animals and how they may grow deep companionship , the goal of creating more of those heartwarming stories in every community.</p>
