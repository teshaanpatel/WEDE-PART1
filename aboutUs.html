<h1>who we are</h1>
<p>our history is that we were founded by a small group of passionate animal lovers who started rescuing strays in their neighbourhood. Initially operating out of personal homes and garages until the team began to grow through social media outreach and community support. Over time gaining recognition for their ethical rescue practices, low-cost vet support, and dedication to educating the public. Tail to Heart would then become a registered non-governmental organization(NGO) and would secure a small facility to operate as both a rescue centre and adoption hub.</p>
<br>
<H3>our mission and vision</H3>

<br>
<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>to create a community and promote attention towards providing pets with the love they deserve, to make people aware of how every rescue is possible, and how every heart finds its tail.
