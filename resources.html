These goals would be:
1.	Increase visibility and community engagement by sharing rescue stories, updates, and upcoming events.
2.	Streamline pet adoption and fostering applications with easy to use online forms.
3.	Promote donation campaigns  by allowing secure online contributions so that pets in need may get more shelters built as well as pet food.
4.	Recruit volunteers and sponsors through detailed info pages and sign up forms.
5.	Educate the public with blog content, downloadable resources, and frequently asked questions about pet care, animal rights, and rescue work to create a better understanding.
