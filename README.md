1. Organisation Overview
• Name: Tail to Heart
• History: 
Tail to Heart originated from a small group of passionate animal lovers who started rescuing stray dogs and cats in their local neighbourhood. What began as informal rescues from personal garages quickly developed into an organised effort, boosted by community donations and social media outreach. As the initiative grew, the team gained recognition for their ethical rescue practices, low-cost veterinary support, and commitment to education. Eventually, Tail to Heart became a registered non-governmental organisation (NGO) and acquired a dedicated facility that serves as both a rescue centre and an adoption hub.
• Mission Statement: 
To rescue, rehabilitate, and rehome stray and abandoned animals while promoting compassion, responsible pet ownership, and active community engagement.
